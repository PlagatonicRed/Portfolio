                    Sterile Coffin is a short, first person, movement shooter, set in an
                    abandoned laboratory. As the player you must escape from this
                    unknown and unnatural environment by fighting your way through waves of
                    enemies.

                        Firstly, I wanted to integrate uml design theory into my game development process and also generally
                        take more time to make proper documentation for any scripts that I make.
                        Secondly, I wanted learn how to use Unity's custom GUI tools to develop more designer friendly
                        tools that could speed up production.

                    Team Size:
                    solo
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Goals:
                    <br> Create a realistic solar system simulation
                    <br> integrate my physics knowledge and interest in astronomy into a game
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    I've always had an interest in astronomy, ever since I was in kindergarten. 
                    I've also always loved watching videos on universe sandbox and been fascinated
                    by how one could develop such games.
                    So when my first game development class tasked us with making a solar system type project,
                    I was excstatic. However, what they wanted us to do was simply have planets rotate about each other
                    something that I thought was rather trivial given the complexity of planetary orbits. So, I decided to
                    make my own version of the project from scratch.
                </p>
                <p><br>                       
                    The first thing, and one of the most challenging, was properly integrating the formulas related to
                    orbital mechanics. I won't go too far into detail here, but I created custom physics to model the gravitational
                    interaction between bodies and also created functions that calculated the orbital path of an object about another.
                    I also wanted it to be as accurate as possible, so I used planetary data-sheets offered by NASA on their website and
                    integrated them into my simulation. I used scriptable objects to store each planets data and to allow for generalization
                    of planetary objects. This resulted in all bodies having (relatively) accurate rotational speeds, orbital inclinations, 
                    orbital speeds, eccentricity, etc. All in all it ended up taking me several hours to just input all the data for the 20 bodies that I included
                    in the game.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    I also used real NASA mappings of many of the bodies (not all of them had complete texture mappings)
                    in order to texture each planet and many of the moons in order to further increase the accuracy of the solar
                    model. Finding these texture mappings also took quite a long time, especially some of the more obscure moons.
                    I also really wanted to provide a 1 to 1 scale distance between stellar bodies, using 1 unit in unity as 1meter
                    however, the distances between each bodie are so vast that it caused immense floating point errors just from the distances
                    between the sun and the Earth, so I had to scale it down by a factor of 100,000.
                    Regardless of this, I do still believe I was able to capture the shear magnitude of the distance between each planet
                    even if it isn't 100% to scale. The other issue, is that the shear difference in size between objects also resulted in floating point
                    imprecision, but instead for mesh vertices, this is particularly noticeable on phobos and deimos, the two smallest major moons in the
                    solar system.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    I was, and still am, very happy with how this project turned out, I think it is one of my most
                    visually and statisically impressive projects, but as a game I do feel that it falls extremely short. 
                    In fact, I would say it's less of a game, and more of an interactive experience. None the less, it is
                    an interactive experience that I love showing to people and nerding out about all the different planetary
                    statistics I incorprorated into this project.
