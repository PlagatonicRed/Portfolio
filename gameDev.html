                    Sterile Coffin is a short, first person, movement shooter, set in an
                    abandoned laboratory. As the player you must escape from this
                    unknown and unnatural environment by fighting your way through waves of
                    enemies.

                        My contributions to Sterile Coffin are primarily programming related, as I was

                        and Enemy AI. Though out of all of these I feel as if I am most proud of the systems I created
                        for the game.

                        I also went into this project with two main things that I wanted to improve on by the end of developement.
                        Firstly, I wanted to integrate uml design theory into my game development process and also generally
                        take more time to make proper documentation for any scripts that I make.
                        Secondly, I wanted learn how to use Unity's custom GUI tools to develop more designer friendly
                        tools that could speed up production.
